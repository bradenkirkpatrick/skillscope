# skillscope

## Description
Skillscope is a project with the goal of informing individuals
about job listings in their area by displaying the requirments
and qualifications many of them have set up.  This will allow the 
individual to view them, and as such determine what they should work
on to be a more hireable individual. At the same time it features the 
ability to use ones own resume which will be compared against the 
various requirements and then show what stands out in the area
and whether it may be advantageous should ones skills be in demand.
This project was made using Kestra to allow for smooth usage and for the 
datamining required to find all of this important information necessary.

## Usage
When wishing to use this project its important to gather and use the appropriate
data so that one may scan the area they desire. This can be general job listing 
sites or something of the sort. Then simply allow Kestra to run the project
and this will provide statistics on the most in demand skills for indviduals 
wishing to compete in the job market within that area. Then one can compare
their own resume against the many prospective requirements found online
to determine if one is in good standing in the job market.
