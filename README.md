# skillscope

## Description
Skillscope is a project with the goal of informing individuals
about job listings in their area by displaying the requirments
and qualifications many of them have set up.  This will allow the 
individual to view them, and as such determine what they should work
on to be a more hireable individual. At the same time it features the 
ability to use ones own resume which will be compared against the 
various requirements and then show what stands out in the area
and whether it may be advantageous should ones skills be in demand.
This project was made using Kestra to allow for smooth usage and for the 
datamining required to find all of this important information necessary.

## Usage
When wishing to use this project its important to gather and use the appropriate
data so that one may scan the area they desire. This can be general job listing 
sites or something of the sort. Then simply allow Kestra to run the project
and this will provide statistics on the most in demand skills for indviduals 
wishing to compete in the job market within that area. Then one can compare
their own resume against the many prospective requirements found online
to determine if one is in good standing in the job market.


## Inspiration
Our inspiration behind our project was to create a cohesive simple and elegant website that intuitively showed the most in demand frameworks and technologies in todays job market using realtime job board data by utilizng the flexibility of Kestra's flows. 
## What it does
Our Kestra flow runs a data miner once a month to initialize the website database by searching job descriptions and calculating the most in demand technologies. Users can then see a list of of these frameworks and can upload their resume to see how an ATS may approach reading their resume. By uploading a resume users are shown what skills they possess that are in demand and can point out areas of improvement
## How we built it
This was built using Kestra Flow automations paired with a React front-end and a Node.js backend both of which are intialized and managed via Kestra.
 
## Challenges we ran into
There were a variety of challenges integrating Kestra into the design of the project as well as many
challenges with getting the various pieces to work such as uploading the pdf to have it be processed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have come together as a team and keeping with the spirit of the season we are thankful to have the wonderful opportunity to spend the time to learn emerging technologies like Kestra and finding real world usecases for our designs. 

## What we learnedg
How excellent a tool Kestra can be when used alongside a project. It can provide excellent utility
in how it is capable of collecting data quite easily. In tandem with how it is able to run various
pieces of a program efficiently to ensure it works as intended it made for an excellent experience
showing how much tools like these can improve quality of life.
